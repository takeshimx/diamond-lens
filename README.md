       ↓
Promote to Active → player_segmentation loads from GCS
       ↓
CI/CD Drift Check → Compare active model's training data vs latest season
       ↓
   ├── none/warning → Deploy proceeds
   └── critical     → Deploy blocked 🚫 (retrain required)
```

**Drift Detection Methods**:

### 10. LLM as a Judge (Automated Quality Evaluation)
**Status**: ✅ Service layer + unit tests complete

**Overview**: A quality assurance framework where a separate LLM (Gemini Flash) automatically scores the output quality of each processing step across multiple dimensions. Designed to log production request I/O to BigQuery and run batch sample evaluations.

**5 Judge Services**:

| # | Judge | Evaluation Target | Evaluation Dimensions | File |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Parse Accuracy** | LLM query parse results | query_type accuracy, metrics extraction, player name resolution, intent understanding | `llm_judge_service.py` |
| 2 | **Synthesizer Quality** | AI-generated responses | Factual accuracy, analytical depth, language quality, structure, completeness | `synthesizer_judge_service.py` |
| 3 | **Reflection Decision** | Self-correction loop | Trigger appropriateness, root cause identification, correction quality, over-correction risk | `reflection_judge_service.py` |
| 4 | **Routing Accuracy** | Supervisor routing | Route accuracy, ambiguity handling, reasoning quality | `routing_judge_service.py` |
| 5 | **Drift Alert Quality** | Data drift detection results | Statistical validity, practical significance, actionability, domain relevance | `drift_alert_judge_service.py` |

**Operational Architecture**:
```
[Real-time] User query → Log step I/O to BigQuery (0 additional Gemini calls)
[Batch]     Sample from BQ → 5 Judges score → Results saved to BQ
```

**E2E Script**:
- `backend/scripts/evaluate_with_llm_judge.py` — Parse accuracy regression testing against golden dataset

**Tests**:
- `test_llm_judge.py`, `test_synthesizer_judge.py`, `test_reflection_judge.py`, `test_routing_judge.py`, `test_drift_alert_judge.py`

### 11. BQ Embedding-based Quality Warning System
**Status**: ✅ Production-ready

**Overview**: A serverless, pay-as-you-go quality warning system that detects when a user's query is similar to past queries that received negative feedback. Uses BigQuery ML `ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING` + `VECTOR_SEARCH` with no always-on instances.

**Architecture**:
```
[Daily Batch: 02:00 UTC]
  llm_interaction_logs (user_rating='bad')
    → JOIN original query via request_id
    → ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING (Vertex AI text-multilingual-embedding-002)
    → INSERT INTO llm_query_embeddings (append-only)

[At Request Time - Parallel with AI response]
  User query → BQ ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING (1 Vertex AI API call)
             → VECTOR_SEARCH against llm_query_embeddings
             → quality_warning flag returned with response
             → Frontend: amber warning banner displayed
```

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **Serverless**: Vertex AI API called only on BQ query execution — zero always-on instances
- **Parallel execution**: `asyncio.gather` runs warning check alongside AI response generation, adding zero perceived latency
- **Append-only**: Both `llm_interaction_logs` and `llm_query_embeddings` are append-only tables (no UPDATE)
- **Feedback-driven**: Improves automatically as users submit negative ratings — no manual labeling required

**Components**:
- `services/bq_embedding_service.py` — VECTOR_SEARCH wrapper with graceful fallback
- `llm_query_embeddings` BQ table — stores embeddings of bad-rated queries
- BQ Scheduled Query (daily) — batch embedding generation
- Frontend warning banner — amber alert with `AlertTriangle` icon

**New BQ Resources**:
- `mlb_analytics_dash_25.query_embedding_model` — Remote model (Vertex AI `text-multilingual-embedding-002`)
- `mlb_analytics_dash_25.llm_query_embeddings` — Embedding storage table
- BQ Connection: `asia-northeast1.vertex_ai_connection`

### 12. Embedding-Based Semantic Data Drift Detection
**Status**: ✅ Production-ready

**Overview**: Complements existing statistical drift detection (KS test / PSI) by detecting *semantic* shifts in pitching characteristics using BigQuery ML embeddings. Weekly snapshots of league-wide pitch arsenal metrics — aggregated per pitch type (4-Seam Fastball, Slider, Changeup, Curveball, etc.) — are embedded and compared against a 4-week rolling baseline using cosine distance.

**Architecture**:
```
[Weekly Batch: Monday 03:00 UTC]
  statcast_master
    → Aggregate per pitch_name: avg_velo, avg_spin, pfx_x, pfx_z,
      api_break_z_with_gravity, release_extension, usage_pct, avg_delta_run_exp
    → Concatenate all pitch types into single metrics_text string
    → ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING → INSERT INTO pitcher_metrics_snapshots

[At Drift Detection Time]
  Current week snapshot embedding
    → ML.DISTANCE (COSINE) vs 4-week baseline centroid
    → semantic_drift_score appended to existing DriftReport
```

**Why per pitch type**: Each pitch type has completely different velocity ranges, spin rates, and movement profiles. Aggregating across all pitch types would mask meaningful changes — e.g., a league-wide velocity drop on fastballs or a shift in slider sweep angle.

**Drift Thresholds**:
| Score | Status |
|-------|--------|
| < 0.10 | `stable` |
| 0.10 – 0.20 | `warning` |
| ≥ 0.20 | `critical` |

**Components**:
- `services/bq_drift_embedding_service.py` — Cosine distance computation via BQ ML
- `services/data_drift_service.py` — `semantic_drift` field added to `DriftReport`
- `queries/create_pitcher_metrics_snapshots.sql` — Table DDL
- `queries/scheduled_pitcher_embedding_weekly.sql` — Weekly embedding generation

**New BQ Resources**:
- `mlb_analytics_dash_25.pitcher_metrics_snapshots` — Weekly pitch arsenal snapshots with embeddings
- BQ Scheduled Query: `pitcher_metrics_weekly_embedding` (Monday 03:00 UTC)

## 🏗 Architecture

### Core Data Processing Pipeline
The application follows a sophisticated 4-step pipeline:

1. **🧠 LLM Query Parsing** (`ai_service._parse_query_with_llm`)
   - Converts natural language (Japanese) to structured JSON parameters
   - Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash to extract player names, metrics, seasons, query types
   - Normalizes player names to English full names

2. **⚙️ Dynamic SQL Generation** (`ai_service._build_dynamic_sql`)
   - Maps extracted parameters to BigQuery table schemas via `query_maps.py`
   - Handles multiple query types: `season_batting`, `season_pitching`, `batting_splits`
   - Supports situational splits (RISP, bases loaded, inning-specific, etc.)
   - **Security**: Uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks

3. **📊 BigQuery Data Retrieval**
   - Executes generated SQL against MLB statistics tables in GCP project `your-project-id`
   - Main tables: `fact_batting_stats_with_risp`, `fact_pitching_stats`
   - Specialized tables for splits: `tbl_batter_clutch_*`, `mart_batter_inning_stats`, etc.

4. **💬 LLM Response Generation** (`ai_service._generate_final_response_with_llm`)
   - Converts structured data back to natural Japanese responses
   - Supports both narrative (`sentence`) and tabular (`table`) output formats

5. **🤖 Autonomous Multi-Agent Reasoning** (`app/services/agents/`)
   - **Supervisor Architecture**: Decouples query routing from data retrieval via a `SupervisorAgent`.
   - **Specialized Agents**: 
     - `StatsAgent`: Handles general statistical queries and trend analysis.
     - `MatchupAgent`: Handles specific head-to-head player historical comparisons.
   - **LangGraph Implementation**: Each agent maintains its own "Oracle" (Planning), "Executor" (Data Retrieval), and "Synthesizer" (Final Reporting) loop.
   - **Feedback Loop**: Agents can self-correct and perform multiple tool calls if the initial measurement is insufficient.
   - **Reflection Loop**: Each agent includes a `reflection` node that detects executor errors (SQL syntax, empty results) and feeds diagnostic context back to the LLM for self-correction, with a max retry cap to prevent infinite loops.
   - **Integrated UI**: Pipes structured chart/table metadata directly into the specialized frontend components.

### ML Model Architecture: 3-Layer Separation of Concerns

The project follows modern MLOps best practices by separating machine learning workflows into three distinct layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [1] Training Layer (Local or Vertex AI Pipelines)              │
│  ├── Notebook/Script: FT-Transformer & K-means training        │

```

#### Why This Architecture?

**2024-2025 Approach (Monolithic):**
- ❌ Training + Inference in FastAPI backend
- ❌ PyTorch in Cloud Run container (3.9GB image size)
- ❌ High memory usage and slow cold starts
- ❌ Tight coupling between training and serving

**2026 Approach (Separation of Concerns):**
- ✅ Training isolated in notebooks/scripts (`scripts/train_and_register_ft_transformer.py`)
- ✅ Models versioned in Vertex AI Model Registry (GCS storage, ~$0.002/month)
- ✅ Lightweight FastAPI backend (no PyTorch in production)
- ✅ Optional Vertex AI Endpoint for high-scale inference
- ✅ Easy rollback and A/B testing with model versions

#### Current Implementation

**Training:**
- Location: `scripts/train_and_register_ft_transformer.py`, `analysis/kmeans_vs_ft_transformer.ipynb`
- Run locally with PyTorch installed
- Registers models to Vertex AI Model Registry

**Inference:**
- Default: Local K-means clustering (lightweight, fast)
- Optional: Vertex AI Endpoint (via HTTP, switchable with env var `USE_VERTEX_AI_ENDPOINT`)
- Automatic fallback to local K-means if Vertex AI fails

**Cost Comparison:**
| Component | Current (Default) | Optional (Vertex AI) |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------|
| Model Storage | GCS: $0.002/month | GCS: $0.002/month |
| Compute | Cloud Run (included) | Endpoint: $73/month (24/7) |
| **Total** | **~$0** | **~$73/month** |

→ **Recommended**: Use default local K-means unless high-scale inference is required.

### Key Configuration System
- **`query_maps.py`**: Central configuration for all query types and metric mappings
- **`QUERY_TYPE_CONFIG`**: Maps query types to table schemas and column mappings
- **`METRIC_MAP`**: Translates semantic metric names to actual database column names
- Supports complex metric mappings across different split contexts

- **State Management**: Remote state stored in GCS bucket

Infrastructure is organized as reusable modules:

```
terraform/
├── modules/
│   ├── cloud-run/         # Reusable Cloud Run module
│   ├── bigquery/          # BigQuery dataset module
│   ├── iam/               # IAM configuration module
│   └── secrets/           # Secret Manager module (not used)
└── environments/
    └── production/        # Production environment config
        └── main.tf        # Main Terraform configuration
```

**Key Features:**
- **Automated testing:** Unit tests run before every deployment
- **Schema validation gate:** Ensures `query_maps.py` matches live BigQuery schema
- **LLM evaluation gate:** Validates LLM parse accuracy against golden dataset before deployment
- **ML drift check gate:** Detects critical data drift in ML model inputs using Model Registry auto-baseline
- **Security scanning:** Trivy scans Docker images for HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities
- **Fail-fast approach:** Test, schema, LLM accuracy, or security failures prevent deployment
- Infrastructure changes are applied before application deployment
- Terraform only executes if infrastructure changes are detected
- Docker images are built and deployed after infrastructure updates
- Secrets are managed outside Terraform for security

### Security

The application implements multiple layers of security to protect against SQL injection, unauthorized access, and other attacks:

**Security Measures:**

0. **Firebase Authentication**:
   - Google Sign-In on the frontend via Firebase SDK (`signInWithPopup` + `GoogleAuthProvider`)
   - Server-side token verification via Firebase Admin SDK (`firebase-admin`)
   - Pure ASGI middleware (`FirebaseAuthMiddleware`) validates `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on all API requests
   - Public paths (`/health`, `/docs`, etc.) are excluded from authentication
   - User identity (`user_id`, `email`) is extracted and passed to endpoints for per-user logging
   - Content Security Policy (CSP) configured to allow Google/Firebase authentication domains

1. **Input Validation** (`_validate_query_params`):
   - Validates all LLM-generated parameters before SQL generation
   - Checks for SQL keywords (SELECT, UNION, DROP, etc.)
   - Enforces character whitelists for player names
   - Validates data types, ranges, and formats
   - Rejects malicious patterns (e.g., `' OR '1'='1`)

2. **Parameterized Queries**:
   - All user inputs are passed as BigQuery query parameters
   - SQL structure is separated from data values
   - Prevents injection attacks at the database level
   - Uses placeholders (e.g., `@player_name`) instead of string concatenation

3. **Whitelist-based ORDER BY**:
   - ORDER BY clauses use only pre-defined columns from `METRIC_MAP`
   - Direct user input never used in ORDER BY clauses

4. **Rate Limiting** (`RateLimitMiddleware` + `slowapi`):
   - Global rate limit (100 req/min) via custom ASGI middleware
   - Per-session rate limit (20 req/min) keyed by Firebase user_id, session ID, or IP
   - Per-endpoint rate limits via slowapi decorators with dynamic `.env` configuration
   - LLM token budget (daily cap) to prevent runaway API costs
   - All rejections logged to Cloud Monitoring and BigQuery `llm_interaction_logs`
   - In-memory storage (no Redis) — suitable for Cloud Run single-container deployment

**Test Coverage:**
- `test_security.py`: SQL injection attack patterns and input validation
- Tests validate both blocking malicious inputs and allowing legitimate ones

### Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests for critical business logic:

**Test Coverage (95+ tests):**
- `test_query_maps.py` (21 tests): Configuration validation and data structure integrity
- `test_build_dynamic_sql.py` (28 tests): SQL generation logic for all query types
- `test_security.py` (13 tests): SQL injection prevention and input validation
- `test_reflection_loop.py` (11 tests): Reflection loop self-correction logic, error classification, and executor empty result detection
- `test_data_drift.py` (17 tests): Data drift detection logic (PSI, KS test, severity determination)
- `test_ft_transformer.py` (5 tests): FT-Transformer encoder architecture and self-supervised training
- `test_model_registry.py` (5+ tests): Model registry service (train, register, load, promote with mocked GCS/BigQuery)

**Run tests locally:**
```bash
cd backend
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)  # Linux/Mac
set PYTHONPATH=%cd%       # Windows
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

**Test categories:**
- Query type configuration validation
- Metric mapping integrity
- SQL generation for season batting/pitching
- Career statistics queries
- Batting splits (RISP, bases loaded, inning-specific, etc.)
- Edge case handling and error validation

### Schema Validation

The Schema Validation GATE ensures data integrity between application configuration and database:

**What it validates:**
- All tables referenced in `query_maps.py` exist in BigQuery
- Required columns (`year_col`, `player_col`, `month_col`) exist in their respective tables
- All `available_metrics` columns exist in the actual table schemas
- All `METRIC_MAP` column mappings point to valid columns

**Run validation locally:**
```bash
cd backend
export GCP_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
export BIGQUERY_DATASET_ID=your-dataset-id
python scripts/validate_schema_config.py
```

**When validation fails:**
- CI/CD pipeline stops immediately (before costly build steps)
- Error messages indicate which columns are missing
- Action required: Update `query_maps.py` or BigQuery schema to match

This gate prevents runtime errors from schema mismatches and catches configuration bugs early.

### Security Scanning

Container images are scanned for vulnerabilities before deployment using Trivy:

**What it scans:**
- Operating system packages (Debian, Alpine, etc.)
- Application dependencies (Python packages, npm packages)
- Known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
- Severity levels: HIGH and CRITICAL only

**Scan process:**
```
Docker Image Build → Push to GCR → Trivy Scan → Deploy (if no vulnerabilities)
```

**When vulnerabilities are found:**
- CI/CD pipeline stops immediately (before deployment)
- Trivy reports which packages have vulnerabilities
- Action required: Update base image or dependencies

**What's checked:**
- Backend image: Python dependencies, OS packages
- Frontend image: Node.js dependencies, nginx, OS packages

This ensures no known high-severity vulnerabilities reach production.

### Monitoring & Alerting

The application implements comprehensive monitoring across infrastructure and application layers:

#### Infrastructure Layer Monitoring

**Uptime Checks:**
- Backend `/health` endpoint: 60-second interval checks from 3 global regions (USA, EUROPE, ASIA_PACIFIC)
- Frontend `/` endpoint: 60-second interval checks from 3 global regions
- SSL validation and HTTPS enforcement

**Alert Policies:**
- **Service Down**: Triggered when uptime checks fail for 60 seconds continuously
- **High Memory Usage**: Alert when Cloud Run memory exceeds 80% for 5 minutes
- **High CPU Usage**: Alert when Cloud Run CPU exceeds 80% for 5 minutes
- **Notification**: Email alerts with 30-minute auto-close after resolution

**Terraform Configuration:**
```bash
cd terraform/environments/production
terraform apply -var="notification_email=your-email@example.com"
```

#### Application Layer Monitoring

**Custom Metrics tracked:**
- `api/latency`: Request latency per endpoint (ms)
- `api/errors`: Error count by endpoint and error type
- `query/processing_time`: Query processing duration by query type (ms)
- `bigquery/latency`: BigQuery execution time by query type (ms)
- `rate_limit/rejections`: Rate limit rejection count by endpoint and limit type (global, session, endpoint)

**Structured Logging:**
- JSON-formatted logs compatible with Google Cloud Logging
- Automatic parsing and indexing by Cloud Logging
- Searchable fields: `timestamp`, `severity`, `message`, `query_type`, `latency_ms`, `error_type`

**Error Classification:**
- `validation_error`: Input validation failures
- `bigquery_error`: Database query failures
- `llm_error`: AI model processing errors
- `null_response`: Empty response from services

**Log Severity Levels:**
- `DEBUG`: Detailed debugging information
- `INFO`: Normal operation events (requests, completions)
- `WARNING`: Non-critical issues
- `ERROR`: Error events that need attention
- `CRITICAL`: Critical failures requiring immediate action

**View logs and metrics:**
```bash
# Cloud Logging
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision" --limit 50

# Cloud Monitoring Metrics Explorer
# Navigate to: Cloud Console → Monitoring → Metrics Explorer
# Custom metrics: custom.googleapis.com/diamond-lens/*
